🌦 Weather Data Storage System
📌 Course: Data Structures (ENCS205 / ENCA 201)
Semester: 3rd
Session: 2025-26
Assignment Number: 01

📖 Problem Statement
Develop a Weather Data Storage System using Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and 2D arrays.
The system should:

Define a Weather Record ADT
Implement a 2D array-based storage for city-wise, year-wise temperature
Support row-major and column-major access
Handle sparse datasets efficiently
Provide time and space complexity analysis
🏗 Features
✅ WeatherRecord ADT for storing date, city, temperature
✅ 2D Array Implementation for city-year storage
✅ Row-major & Column-major access for traversal
✅ Sparse Data Handling using triplet (row, col, value) representation
✅ Efficient Operations with time & space complexity analysis
